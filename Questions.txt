Questions:

1. To create a table for the Professor review/edit Scores page, how does the code for the Select Questions
page change if the table is created and rendered on page load? It also only needs to be rerendered when the professor 
finishes editing a score 

2. The edit button in the above table needs to open some kind of second table that shows the points the student got on 
each question and makes the field edittable. (Kind of like how the selected table allowed a point value to be entered, except
the point value is pre-populated by the amount of points the student received)
So like
Question Input         Total Points Available      Points Awarded(This is the edittable field)
    (Student input)            10                     8       
    (Student input)            15                     10
    (Student input)            5                      5
      etc.

      (The question input might just have to be Question number for now, depending on how Aaron is relaying the exam score
      iggy now, im not sure how he's sending it, Maybe the second table is always visible as well. I don't think it matters
      for this version of the code)

3. When the student takes the exam, I'm going to receive a JSON with a questions array. The options for each question
should be "question id" "Instructions"  "Point Value" and "testcases" but I need to break up in-between each question with a textarea
for the student to input their answer. So I need to render
    Instructions:(Question instructions)
    Worth: (Point Value) points
    (Not sure i want to render the testcases at all, but they do need to be submitted to Aaron)
    textarea
    (I do not want to render the question ID but i do still need it to send it to Aaron)

    Instructions:(Question instructions)
    Worth: (Point Value) points
    (Not sure i want to render the testcases at all, but they do need to be submitted to Aaron)
    textarea

    (Etc for however many questions appear on the exam)

4. Using Post data, i plan to cURL from PHP all this data to Aaron in a JSON. How do I take the data for each question
and put it in an array to pull the $POST variable later in the cURL
The JSON should look like
{
    "questions":[
        "id":
        "inputCode":
        "pointValue":
        "testcases":[
            {
                "input1":
                "output1":
            }
            {
                "input2":
                "output2":
            }
        ],
        "id":
        "inputCode":
        "pointValue":
        "testcases":[
            {
                "input1":
                "output1":
            }
            {
                "input2":
                "output2":
            }
    ]
}etcetcetc
